### About this project

Spam messages are unsolicited and unwanted messages. Fraudsters use spam messages to trick people into giving them your personal information â€” things like your password, account number, or even credit card information.

These messages are designed in such a way people fall for it. This is because it is difficult for people with little knowledge about scams to determine if sms is from a scammer.

In this project, I will build an application that can help determine if an SMS is spam or not. The project is all about teaching the computer how to classify messages. To do that, I will use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans that understands what spam messages are.
THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

### Summary of the project
- Idenified a problem that can be solved with machine learning (Spam sms detection) 
- Trained a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm that can predict spam SMS from normal SMS using a dataset of 5,572 SMS labelled by humans.

- Deployed the prediction model as a web service using [Bentoml](https://www.bentoml.com/) *Why i used bentoml*
