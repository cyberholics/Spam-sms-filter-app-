# About this project

Spam messages are unsolicited and unwanted messages. Fraudsters use spam messages to trick people into giving them your personal information â€” things like your password, account number, or even credit card information.

These messages are designed in such a way people fall for them. This is because it is difficult for people with little knowledge about scams to determine if sms is from a scammer.

In this project, I will build an application that can help determine if an SMS is spam or not. The project is all about teaching the computer how to classify messages. To do that, I will use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans that understands what spam messages are.
THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM

# Project files and folder explained 

### SMSSpamCollection
> This is a dataset of 5,572 SMS stored as a CSV file. The data was gotten from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection)

### spam filter with naive bayes.ipynb
> This is a Jupyter notebook where I cleaned, analyzed, explored the dataset, and build my model. It is important you check it out to gain more insight into this project.

# Summary of the project
- Identified a problem that can be solved with machine learning (Spam sms detection) 
- Trained a multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm that can predict spam SMS from normal SMS using a dataset of 5,572 SMS labelled by humans.

- Deployed the prediction model as a web service using [Bentoml](https://www.bentoml.com/) *Why I used bentoml*
